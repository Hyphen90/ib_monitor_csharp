# Bar Aggregator Service Implementation

## Overview

The BarAggregatorService provides a clean, event-driven solution for converting 5-second real-time bars from Interactive Brokers into 10-second aggregated bars. This replaces the previous timer-based approach with a more reliable bar-completion detection system.

## Architecture

```
IB API (5s bars) → RealTimeBarService → BarAggregatorService → PositionMonitorService
```

### Flow Description

1. **RealTimeBarService** receives 5-second bars from IB API
2. **BarAggregatorService** processes raw bars and aggregates pairs into 10-second bars
3. **PositionMonitorService** receives clean 10-second bars for trailing stop logic

## Key Features

### 1. Alignment Detection
- Automatically detects when bars are aligned to 10-second boundaries (0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 seconds)
- Discards non-aligned bars until the first aligned bar is received
- Ensures consistent 10-second intervals

### 2. Bar Aggregation
- Combines two consecutive 5-second bars into one 10-second bar
- Proper OHLC aggregation:
  - **Open**: First bar's open price
  - **High**: Maximum of both bars' high prices
  - **Low**: Minimum of both bars' low prices
  - **Close**: Second bar's close price
  - **Volume**: Sum of both bars' volumes
  - **Count**: Sum of both bars' trade counts
  - **WAP**: Volume-weighted average price

### 3. State Management
- Per-symbol aggregation state tracking
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking
- State cleanup when symbols change

## Implementation Details

### BarAggregatorService Class

```csharp
public class BarAggregatorService
{
    public event Action<int, Bar>? AggregatedBarReady;
    
    public void ProcessRawBar(int tickerId, Bar rawBar, string symbol)
    public void ClearState(string symbol)
    public void ClearAllStates()
    public string GetAggregationStatus(string symbol)
}
```

### BarAggregationState Class

```csharp
internal class BarAggregationState
{
    public Bar? ProcessRawBar(Bar rawBar, MonitorConfig config)
    public void Reset()
    public string GetStatus(string symbol)
}
```

## Debug Output

When `BarDebug` is enabled in config, the service provides detailed logging:

```
DISCARDING NON-ALIGNED BAR: 14:32:07 (seconds: 7)
FIRST ALIGNED BAR RECEIVED: 14:32:10 (seconds: 10) - Aggregation now active
STORING FIRST BAR OF PAIR: 14:32:10
AGGREGATING PAIR: 14:32:10 + 14:32:15 → 14:32:15
AGGREGATED BAR READY: AAPL 14:32:15 O:150.25 H:150.45 L:150.20 C:150.40 V:1250 [10s from 2x5s bars]
```

## Configuration

The service uses existing configuration options:

```json
{
  "UseBarBasedTrailing": true,
  "BarInterval": 5,
  "BarDebug": true
}
```

- **UseBarBasedTrailing**: Enables bar-based trailing stop functionality
- **BarInterval**: Must be set to 5 (seconds) for proper aggregation
- **BarDebug**: Enables detailed debug output for troubleshooting

## Integration Points

### RealTimeBarService Changes

```csharp
// Initialize bar aggregator
_barAggregator = new BarAggregatorService(_logger, _config);
_barAggregator.AggregatedBarReady += OnAggregatedBarReady;

// Process raw bars through aggregator
_barAggregator.ProcessRawBar(reqId, bar, symbol);
```

### PositionMonitorService

No changes required - continues to receive bars via the existing `RealTimeBarReceived` event, but now gets clean 10-second aggregated bars instead of raw 5-second bars.

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: No dependency on timers or external timing mechanisms
2. **Accuracy**: Proper bar completion detection based on actual data
3. **Simplicity**: Clean separation of concerns between services
4. **Debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
5. **Thread Safety**: Proper locking for concurrent access
6. **Maintainability**: Clear, well-documented code structure

## Error Handling

- Graceful handling of malformed bar timestamps
- Safe state management with null checks
- Proper cleanup on symbol changes
- Thread-safe operations throughout

## Testing Considerations

- Test with various market conditions (pre-market, regular hours, after-hours)
- Verify alignment detection with different start times
- Confirm proper aggregation of OHLC values
- Test state cleanup when switching symbols
- Validate thread safety under concurrent access

## Future Enhancements

- Support for different aggregation intervals (configurable)
- Historical bar aggregation for backtesting
- Performance metrics and monitoring
- Advanced error recovery mechanisms
